## Data cleaning tasks:
Using SQL to perform this task we did the following :

* Verify the completeness and accuracy of the data. Check for missing values and errors in the data.
* Handle missing values. Consider imputing missing values with meaningful values or dropping rows with too many missing values.
* Handle errors in the data. Check for outliers, duplicate records, and inconsistencies in the data and correct them as necessary.
* Normalize and standardize the data. Convert data into a common format, such as converting categorical variables into numerical variables.
* Remove unnecessary columns. Remove columns that are not relevant to the analysis or have low data quality.
